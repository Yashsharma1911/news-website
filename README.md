### If this project has helped you and you'd like to support my work, feel free to ♥️ Sponsor the project
### A improved version 2 on the way 🎉

## Description

this is reactJs & bootstrap based news website. This website is fully responsive in any device. Data will fetch from api powered by [Newsapi](https://newsapi.org/). This means that you don't need to manage any database it can be customized and used by anybody simply by some changes in api through api the changes will be dynamically fed into the site. If you would like to use this project for your own personal project, read on to learn how to build your own copy.

## Make it your own!
### 1. Make sure you have what you need
To build this website, you will need to have Node >=6 downloaded and installed on your machine. If you don't already have it, you can get it [HERE](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### 2. Clone repository
Once you download nodejs in your machine all you have to do download my code by hitting the green "clone or download" button above and hit download zip.

### 3. Run following commands
Next you need to run some commands in your terminal but terminal should be opnen that folder
Lrt's install node_module
```bash
npm install
```
following command will install some dependencies
```bash
npm install --save react-infinite-scroll-component
```
```bash
npm install --save react-top-loading-bar
```
## Last step
Last step you are almost done you need to create a .env.local file in main directory 
take your api key from [HERE](https://newsapi.org/)

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
